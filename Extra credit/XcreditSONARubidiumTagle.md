## Reflection

The Agendas in SONA 2025 were generally good, beneficial to the Filipinos. I have hopes for some of them; especially in the fields of Education and Flood control because they are the ones that need, *in my opinion*, attention the most. With the ongoing issues around the world, I'm glad that he put peace as his priority; making the Philippines have no enemies.

There are other Programs that seem either too ambitious or too flawed. One of them is putting their focus more on our athletes and the Philippine Sports Commission — while it doesn't sound too bad, because it is a great thing, PSC has past with corruption; we cannot verify how well they can handle our athletes. As I've previously mentioned above, the Bente Pesos Bigas program is too ambitious for me; it is possible but I think it isn't a long term program. With the increase projects for infrastructure, I still think that those projects would last for 5-10 years, given our past with infrastructure.

`What one word/phrase/sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025:`

### Don't get your hopes too high
