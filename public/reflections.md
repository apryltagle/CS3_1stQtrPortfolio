`5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well`
1. **Operators** - Besides getting prior knowledge from CS 2, I learned more about their properties and why javascript prioritizes these operators by order. What I found interesting are comparison operators, specifically && and ||. It's really interesting that && prioritizes *false* and || prioritizes *true*. Additionally, it's fascinating that && prioritizes the *2nd statement* and || prioritizes the *1st statement*.
2. **Variables** - At first, I found variables difficult because it was a culture shock after using C++ for a year. But after a while, I got a hang of it and I got the difference between *let* and *const*.
3. **Switch Statement** - Since CS2, this is my favorite statement to use. It's a really easy statement to use and it can be understood easily.
4. **While Loops** - I've used this a lot during CS2 so I pretty much got a hang of it. This is also relatively easy to understand and I use it all the time.
5. **HTML Tags** - Similar to variables, I also found this kind of difficult. Fortunately, after studying, it got relatively easier to understand what their function in html.

`5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why`
1. **Functions** - This is actually easy but I still don't get the difference between functions as a declaration and as an expression. I might need a more thorough discussion on this one and that's about it.
2. **For Loops** - Although I use this a lot, this still confuses me. The process of for loops, especially nested ones, confuse me because I don't know if they're passed down to the nested loop or not.
3. **Do While Loops** - By far, the most confusing loops I've ever used. Since CS2, I heavily dislike using this loop because of how confusing the process of it.
4. **Output** - There are multiple outputs so naturally, I would get confused by them. I need more practice/discussion about the differences between the outputs.
5. **If and If-else statements** - I do use it on a daily but I keep forgetting that these statements are done from top to bottom. I almost forgot that syntax existed during the coding part of LT1. If it weren't for me remembring the compiler reading the statements from top to bottom, I would've failed the coding part of the exam.

`Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.`
1. I shall look into more sources about the topics I've listed like w3schools. Other than that, I can also ask sir through consultation so I could get a deeper understanding of the topics I've listed.

`In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?`

##### Effective

1. Doing the bonus within the class period is really effective considering that it is forcing us students to research more about topics that we haven't discussed in order to get a bonus. For example, when we're asked to do this particular task in 20-30 minutes, I understood the topic quickly. Persoanlly, I just think I like to work under pressure.
2. Doing exercises in class is effective for me because I can ask some guidance from sir. With a direct guidance from sir, I can understand why my code doesn't work and how the process should be.

##### Not Effective

1. Coding in class together is quite challenging for me. Since students have different learning paces, it's hard for me to catch up with what the teacher is explaining but that only happens rarely.
2. There's also one more thing that isn't effective for me, it's doing bonuses outside classes. It isn't necessarily inside the class (like what the question has mentioned but I really coun't think of anything) but I think this proves my point from the effective part. I just like to do things under pressure and I don't get motivated if I'm not.
